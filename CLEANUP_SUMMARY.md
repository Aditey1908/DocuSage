# DocuSage Cleanup and Reorganization

This document summarizes the changes made to clean up and reorganize the DocuSage project structure.

## Changes Made

### Consolidation

1. **Combined Flask Apps**
   - Merged `app.py` and `app_thread.py` into a single consolidated `docusage.py`
   - All functionality is preserved with a cleaner, more maintainable codebase

2. **Improved File Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `data/` directory for storing documents
   - Organized thread documents into `data/thread_documents/` 

3. **Temporary File Handling**
   - Replaced permanent file creation with tempfile usage
   - Added proper cleanup of temporary question files
   - Added file handling safeguards and error handling

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with new structure and file organization
   - Organized API endpoints documentation
   - Added clear shutdown instructions

5. **Process Management**
   - Added signal handlers for clean shutdown
   - Implemented process cleanup to prevent orphaned processes

### Cleanup

1. **Removed Unnecessary Files**
   - Cleaned up temporary and duplicate files
   - Consolidated redundant code

2. **Organized Requirements**
   - Grouped dependencies by functionality
   - Cleaned up requirements file

## Running the New Structure

1. **Clean up the old structure** (optional):
   ```
   python cleanup.py
   ```

2. **Run the server**:
   ```
   python docusage.py
   ```

3. **Shutdown properly**:
   Press Ctrl+C and the server will cleanly terminate all processes.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Maintenance**: One main file instead of two separate apps
- **Better Organization**: Clear folder structure for data storage
- **Cleaner Shutdown**: No more orphaned processes when stopping the server
- **Resource Efficiency**: Proper cleanup of temporary files
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and error recovery
